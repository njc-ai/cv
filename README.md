# Nick Candler

## *Hi 👋 I'm Nick, a full stack marketer 🤗*  
I enjoy rolling up my sleeves and executing as much as I enjoy setting strategy & teaching others.<br><br>
I prefer the uncertainty of early stages, <br>
and like getting into the weeds of design and copy, <br>
or automating tasks in Python, <br>
as much as storytelling and championing the growth vision to the broader team.
